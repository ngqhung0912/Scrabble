- Save all words by players in the board in a dictionary, then re-loop the dictionary to find it later if there

method newWordFormed to check all the word formed, along with the user-intended word.
hashmap WordPlayed to store all the word previously has been played, among with their coordiates.

- Blank tile: implement a method to ask the user to choose a letter, then convert it to a tile

ComputerPlayer ideas: Copy the game, determine all possible places to place a word, then use game.determinePossibleWordCombination()
to check which of the places have the highest score combination.

- guard: starting position must be H8.
- check if the starting position of the move already have the tile of the same kind. If not then pass the turn.

- after the first round, the player have to put their tiles next to at least 1 existing tile on the board during the remaining game
- JUnit test: if the players use more letter of the same type then they have on the tray
- putWordInSquare: guard - check whether the nextPosition already has a tile or not, if true, return null
- Every player input should be turned into upper case letters


- Current debugging progress: hasTile done.
