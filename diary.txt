- It was a productive day

16/1/2022:
- Logic for tray assigning in controller: Initialize localPlayer with
- Save all words by players in the board in a dictionary, then re-loop the dictionary to find it later if there
is a word connected to that tile.

17/1/2022:
To do list:
- Implementing the input controller.
- When will localGame ends?
- Do our localGame run both locally and on a network, or only on network? i.e. you have use 4 different terminals to connect to
localGame and run?

18/1/2022:

method newWordFormed to check all the word formed, along with the user-intended word.
hashmap WordPlayed to store all the word previously has been played, among with their coordiates.

19/1/2022:
- Blank tile: implement a method to ask the user to choose a letter, then convert it to a tile (v)

ComputerPlayer ideas: Copy the localGame, determine all possible places to place a word, then use localGame.determinePossibleWordCombination()
to check which of the places have the highest score combination.

- guard: starting position must be H8.
- check if the starting position of the move already have the tile of the same kind. If not then pass the turn.

- after the first round, the localPlayer have to put their tiles next to at least 1 existing tile on the board during the remaining localGame
- JUnit test: if the players use more letter of the same type then they have on the tray
- putWordInSquare: guard - check whether the nextPosition already has a tile or not, if true, return null
- Every localPlayer input should be turned into upper case letters

22/1/2022
- the square for new word input hasn't been append to other squares

21/1/2022:
- Current debugging progress: the word has been put twice. (done)

22/1/2022:
- not possible to place tile above and below
- new input method: Ask user to place each tiles separately into the desired square, instead of words.
- List of implements to be done if the input method changed:
+ determineMove of localPlayer (v)
+ checkmove of localPlayer (v)
+ isValidMove of localGame receives hashMap<string, string> (v)
+ putWordInSquare of localGame (v)
+ determinePossibleWordCombination (v)

- implement linkedhashmap because it can index.

- if the word has 2 letters of the same type, it will skip the first letter (v)
- turnScore: add score for invalid wordCombination
- Cannot append an input with an existing tile on the board (v)
- Cannot put tiles in 2 non-consecutive squares (v)
- Some methods blow up after a few rounds

- After 4 consecutive PASS => GAMEOVER
- Only calculate the score for word made from the tile place
- The Scanner has a little buffer (1KB char buffer) as opposed to the BufferedReader (8KB byte buffer), but it's more
  than enough. BufferedReader is a bit faster as compared to scanner because scanner does parsing of input data and
  BufferedReader simply reads sequence of characters

23/1/2022: We were tired.
24/1/2022: I was super sick.
25/1/2022: Networking day.
26/1/2022
- Restructure class LocalPlayer and NetworkPlayer extends Interface player. deadline today (V)
- Restructure class LocalController to control local localGame (Like a local server). deadline today (V)
- Implement + Server
            + Client
            + ClientHandler
            + NetworkView

- Bug: Cannot place tiles when all the tiles is on the left of the current word, i.e BAL on the left of D.


29/1/2022:
dear diary,

today was a really productive day. We got a lot of work done - and also 6 episodes of the Office.

- is our handling of error correct? error | errorname?


30/1/2022:
what's left to be done:
-Javadoc (v)
-Testing (v)
-debugging for networking and gamelogic (v)
-metric report
-Academic skills
-class diagram (1/3 v)
-MVC description
-overview of functional requirements
-time limit

31/1/2022
- Debug in progress: Cannot remove entry from clients HashMap

Multithreading is not working as expected...

The server calls are always seems to be earlier than the thread call, i.e. the server will broadcast gameReady
before the threads can even say hello to its clients.
